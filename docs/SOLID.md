# SOLID Principles in this Project

Based on the code provided and the architectural patterns identified, here's how the SOLID principles are applied (or could be further emphasized) in this project:

*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
    *   `DashboardViewModel`: Primarily responsible for managing the UI state and handling user interactions related to the dashboard.
    *   `DefaultInOpenAppRepository`: Focused on data retrieval and storage from different sources.
    *   `InMemoryInOpenAppDataSource` and `InOpenAppRemoteDataSource`: Each responsible for providing data from a specific source (local and remote, respectively).
    *   Each `DashboardUiModel` (e.g., `DashboardHeader`, `DashboardTabLayout`): Represents a specific part of the UI, adhering to the principle that a class should have only one reason to change.
*   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
    *   The use of interfaces like `InOpenAppRepository`, `InOpenAppRemoteDataSource`, and `InMemoryInOpenAppDataSource` allows for extending functionality without modifying the existing code. For example, you could add a new type of data source without altering the repository.
    *   The `DashboardUiAction` and `DashboardUiEvent` interfaces allow for adding new actions and events without modifying existing implementations.
*   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
    *   The interfaces `InOpenAppRepository`, `InOpenAppRemoteDataSource`, and `InMemoryInOpenAppDataSource` should ensure that their implementations can be substituted without altering the correctness of the program.
*   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
    *   The `DashboardUiModel` interface and its data class implementations (`DashboardHeader`, `DashboardTabLayout`, `DashboardSupportFooter`) segregate the UI into distinct models, each responsible for a specific part of the UI.
    *   The `DashboardUiAction` and `DashboardUiEvent` interfaces segregate the actions and events into distinct interfaces, each responsible for a specific action or event.
*   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
    *   The `DefaultInOpenAppRepository` depends on abstractions (`InMemoryInOpenAppDataSource` and `InOpenAppRemoteDataSource`) rather than concrete implementations.
    *   The use of dependency injection (with Hilt) facilitates the decoupling of components and makes the code more testable. The `DashboardViewModel` depends on the `InOpenAppRepository` interface, not a concrete implementation.

In summary, the project demonstrates a good adherence to SOLID principles, particularly with the use of interfaces, dependency injection, and separation of concerns.
